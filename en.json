    "story": "    Established in December 2015, Fluxonaut started with the mission to help\n    people deal with the insurmountable amount of information we all must handle\n    nowadays. We believe that with the right tool, you can tame your flow and\n    not only take control of what and when you consume but increase the amount\n    you can handle without the extra stress or anxiety that usually comes with\n    tracking more sources.\n      <br />\n    <br />\n    We want to give you the power to aggregate and organize the many information\n    flows you’re exposed to, from news to videos, to social media, to financial\n    data - all in real-time. As a result, it isn’t industry-specific but rather\n    has flexibility and customization at its heart, to feature only the content\n    that you really care about, whatever the subject might be. You can leverage\n    the power of multiple screens with the desktop version or keep informed\n    wherever you are with the mobile version - setting up your Fluxonaut\n    dashboard will produce a very personal experience.\n      <br />\n    <br />\n    Making all of the above possible wouldn’t mean much if the result was an\n      expensive tool where only those with considerable purchasing power would\n    have access to, as is the case with some dashboard-like products out there,\n    so we took upon ourselves the challenge to deliver such a tool in an\n    affordable way.\n      <br />\n    <br />\n    Fluxonaut is a labor of love. We are a very small team who took on a big\n    ambition - to change the way we consume information - and it took us four\n    years to reach the first version, we hope you like it!",
